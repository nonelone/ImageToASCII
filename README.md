> ImageToASCII
This is a simple, command-line based script, which when supplied with path to an image and desired scale, will create text file (called output.txt) with given image converted to long string consisting of ".", ":". "o", "0" and "#"
It uses sys and PIL modules to achieve just that
The script itself is MIT-licenced
